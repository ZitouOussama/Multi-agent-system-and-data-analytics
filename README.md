# Multi-agent-system-and-data-analytics

The project is a machine learning (Python) and multi-agent systems (Spring Boot) approach to predicting and monitoring COVID-19 cases in Morocco. The project uses data on COVID-19 cases in different regions of Morocco to train predictive models based on machine learning. It also uses a multi-agent system to monitor and track COVID-19 cases in real-time. Project results can help Moroccan health authorities make informed public health decisions to address the COVID-19 pandemic.
